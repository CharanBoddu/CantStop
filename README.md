<h1 align="center">Can't Stop! Game</h1>
<h4 align="center">A Group Academic project that replicates the well-known board game "Can't Stop!" as a video digitalized game.</h4> <br>

The source code for this object-oriented game was created using java cooperatively with a team for an academic assignment; as a result, it cannot be shared. The code has been structured using polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, which significantly contributed to the project's success. Together with team members, I developed the roll-dice functionalityÂ and created the load-game and save-game functionality.

The following video demonstrates the Can't Stop game, it includes change music functionality, the ability to save at any point, and load it later.
